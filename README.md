# NgDemoApp

## Project Setup

To start this project, you will need to do the following steps.  From the base project directory:

1. Run `npm install` to install all required dependencies.
2. Run `npm start` or `ng serve` to start the dev server (in most cases, they are interchangeable - see [this link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40190538/when-to-use-npm-start-and-when-to-use-ng-serve) if you want to know more about when they're not)
3. Navigate to <http://localhost:4200/>. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Notes

- I have provided a .npmrc file that should help with any proxy issues you may have while using npm.  If you are not on the VPN, you may need to delete or rename the .npmrc file in the project's base directory to resolve any timeout issues.
- This project uses [JSON Placeholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com) data for its components.  They have lots of different sample datasets you can use for your own projects.
